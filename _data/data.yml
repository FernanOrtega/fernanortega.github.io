    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After participating in several related projects of R&D, I am skilled in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, or Machine Learning. I'm just finished my PhD. Its main contributions are an aspect-based sentiment analysis system that takes conditions into account, two deep-learning-based condition mining proposals, and a dataset to evaluate condition miners. Before my PhD, I co-founded Opileak, in which I led R&D. My interests focus on both technical topics like machine learning, NLP, deep learning or sofware engineering and business topics.

experiences:
    - role: PhD Candidate & Teaching assistant
      time: 2015 - Present
      company: University of Sevilla
      details: |
        I received a grant for my job contract from April 2015 to March 2019. Research on my PhD problem: condition mining and an aspect-based sentiment analysis system that takes conditions into account. Lecturer in the course “Design & Testing”, at third level of Software Engineering Degree, in which students learn important concepts regarding Web Information Systems development like: MVC paradigm, conceptual modeling, functional testing, performance testing, acceptance testing, or project management.

    - role: CTO & co-founder
      time: 2013 - 2015
      company: Opileak, Sevilla
      details: |
        Business modelling and definition of new products (based on Opileak). Customer service to ensure the resolution of technical issues. Management of development and maintenance. Management of development teams (front-end, back-end, and NLP algorithms). Development of back-end and NLP algorithms.

    - role: Research assistant
      time: 2012 - 2013
      company: University of Sevilla
      details: |
        I assisted Rafael Corchuelo in this project. I developed a social media analysis platform that retrieves social media messages at web scale. Furthermore, we implemented several algorithms of text mining: polarity analysis, terminology extraction, and summary generation. Known NLP techniques, like pos-tagging, were our algorithm basis.

    - role: Backend developer
      time: 2010 - 2012
      company: Dinamic Area, Sevilla
      details: |
        I implemented algorithms and techniques of text mining and social media analysis. I worked in two projects. Both were funded by CTA (an institution that Andalusian Government owns) and managed by Sadiel, a Spanish Company.
